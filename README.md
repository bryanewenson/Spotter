# Spotter

This project aims to help Spotify users decide which playlists are most fitting for tracks that they are having trouble placing. Long term goals include playlist and track metadata visualization, clustering subsets of songs into generated playlists, and further tuning of the underlying classification methods.

To set this project up locally, you must first register with the Spotify API and replace the client_id and client_secret values in config.py with your own values. This is a temporary solution that will be resolved in future versions of the project.
